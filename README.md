## What is [Roc-Soc]?

> This is a soccer game that two players could fight with each other
and try to bounce the ball into the rival's goal. Try to win over
your rival by getting the most scores in the given time. The game 
should be fun and I chose this game because I'm always interested
in setting up with the object animations and transitions either on
the webpage or in the games.
